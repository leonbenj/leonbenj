As I'm applying to jobs in BC, I recall one key thing I did at Tesla where no one asked me to do which helped my teams become aligned and improve their speed... 
<p>
It was creating processes, structure and training where there was none. 
<p>
Speed was critical in our day to day. And having clarity with what was important made it simpler to execute.
<p>
This made all the difference to those who felt overwhelmed. 
<p>
Unsure what to do in specific situations? 
You can search it in the new guides. 
<p>
Unsure how to handle specific sales objections? 
Search the best-practice sales talking points I had collected from the top sales performers and during our huddles. 
<p>
As I reminisce over my time there, I refined my aptitudes and soft skills as I felt like EVERYTHING was on the line. 
<p>
EVERYTHING was lit up and I felt like I was giving my best in every moment. Especially during tough escalations, that is when relying on processes can help feel more relaxed and in control. 
<p>
Until I find the next team I'm working with, I might as well share some nuggets here.

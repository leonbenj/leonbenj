<h1>The One Thing That Can Set You Apart - Speed</h1>

Speed of implementation is key. While being an entrepreneur, this stood out to me the most. For some reason, getting things done FAST mattered.
<p>
In today's age, if you can get things done, that's good. But getting things done FAST... is the next level if you want to get ahead.
<p>
Plus, if you are good and fast, you're a luxury to your clients.
<p>
<h3>But what keeps us from doing things fast?</h3>
<p>
Overthinking.
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Do I have the right plan?</li>
    <li>Do I know what the client wants?</li>
    <li>Do I still need to research about this topic?</li>
    <li>Do I need to perfect my idea before executing?</li>
</ul>
<p>
What about using the right tools?
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Google Sheets or Numbers or Excel</li>
    <li>Google Docs, Pages or Word</li>
    <li>etc etc etc</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Just get it done in the scrappiest way possible.</h3>
<p>
Get to a point where you know 80% of what needs to be done. Get a version of it out there in the universe. Even if it's just the draft. With the feedback you'll receive, you'll know where to tweak it.
<p>
And the rest will follow. People will notice. And you will win. Do it.
<p>
You will see the difference in just a week.

PS: This is the same principle that I am using to start this blog and website overall. I don't want to spend hours and hours figuring out how every detail works. I am doing it in the easiest way that I can with as little roadblocks that I create for myself.

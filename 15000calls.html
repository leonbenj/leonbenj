<h1>Two key sales skills after 15,000 calls at Tesla</h1>

<p>
Here are two sales skills I think are important after over 15,000 calls with customers and being one of the top advisors in influenced orders at Tesla. 
<p>
I've honed in on various skillsets in controlling conversations, setting expectations and handling objections. 
<p>
Key #1: 
<p>
One of the keys for me in sales is asking direct questions with the intent on helping the other person. 
<p>
Ask as many questions as possible to clearly understand their intent. 
<p>
Open ended questions work best in this phase to allow them the freedom to choose which direction to head towards. 
<p>
This starts to position you with trust as you are seen as curious to help.
<p>
At the end of the day, you are also helping the person you're speaking with to get to their goals. 
<p>
How can you help them if you are unclear on what they want?  
<p>
Key #2:
<p>
Careful listening between the lines is also another key because some customers are unclear in what they are looking for. 
<p>
They might tip-toe around their core issue or might not even be aware what their core issue even is. 
<p>
Guide their confusion with your knowledge and experience.
<p>
You might have trouble-shooted with another customer earlier with a similar situation. 
<p>
So you might know exactly what to look out for to see if they are in the same situation. 
<p>
Probe them to discect their problem and you can give the proper advice from there. 
<p>
Just like how a plumber can tighten one bolt to fix a toilet, but knowing exactly which one to twist is they key. 
<p>
This simply requires your curiosity and a bit of knowledge on past experiences. Even ask your team if they have encountered similar situations as well. 
<p>
Be patient but start being aware of these two skills and you will be well on your way. 
<p>
I hope this enlightens your sales approach as these simple tweaks have helped me and my team to be hyper-efficient and trusted by our customers.
<p>
I'm excited to take what I've learned from Tesla to the next company I work with and with the next business I start for myself.

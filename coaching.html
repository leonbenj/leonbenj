<strong>Here's a bit of my background for context: </strong>  
<p>
I'm a self-starter who built a physical product business. I am comfortable with operations and logistics. Via my Dumpling Nation business, me and my partner made a total of 12,100 dumplings by hand in a small kitchen and delivered them to our customers within the same week. All while selling out in advance from Instagram and an email list. 
<p>
I've been a consistent peak performer at Tesla over 2 years. I've been the most productive and collaborative agent on the Canadian team to resolve concerns fast - internally to our teams and with customers. I can help you see things you can't and get moving at top speed. Plus, you get the mind of a mechanical engineer on your side with a perspective in terms of design, cost of goods, processes and collaboration throughout your team.

<h2>Tesla Recap</h2>
<p>
    Here is my Tesla recap from my 2.5 years of experience from Oct 2021 to April 2024. I won't be sharing every detail but here are some highlights I'm most proud of in no particular order:
<p>
    
<h3>HIGHLIGHTS:</h3> 
    
<p>
    Scored 4.0 on my last 3 x Performance Accelerations with strong technical ability, performance and tight collaboration across multi-disciplinary teams.
<p>
    Developed stronger confidence in myself in my ability to impact Tesla's mission in a high pressure and intense work environment. Especially when starting off on inbound calls where every moment counts.
<p>    
    Gathered the maximum amount of RSUs as I could with my performance and promotions across various roles and responsibilities: Sales & Delivery inbound advisor, Ownership Loyalty Program advisor, Chat leader, 3rd party lease loss-prevention advisor, Quality Assurance Coordinator, Supervisor and taking on Self-Serve Demo Drive (SSDD) in Canada.
<p>
    Developed strong collaboration skills and maintained healthy relationships across various teams: follow-ups with customers, positive office vibes, travelled to US twice, field team relations, as well as with leaders.
<p> 
    Realized I am better at sales than I previously thought and contributed in sharing best practices during sales huddles and created a standardization of Tesla talking points and internal resources for all our virtual teams (Sales, delivery)
<p>  
    Resourceful and factual. Trusted point-of-contact for checking Tesla policy and processes in virtual teams.
<p>
    Taking on projects with an attitude towards obsessive documentation and weekly reporting: Chat, QA, SSDD. This helped me improve on my excel skills as well.
<p>
    Open to criticism and consistent improvement: I was seeking critical feedback weekly to improve on existing and future work.
<p>
<p>
<h3> CHALLENGES</h3>
    <p>
    Demonstrated patience and embraced the unknown to assist customers with limited knowledge, being a beacon of light towards my team in darker times, and pivoting towards business needs for 7+ months before getting back into other areas of the business I was personally looking forward to.
    <p>
    I was starting to see my girlfriend less and less as I transitioned into a supervisor position and struggled with scheduling activities outside of work. My physical health was starting to dip.
    <p>
    <p>
<h3>  AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY </h3>
<p> 
    Scheduling non-negotiable workouts, journal sessions and activities outside of work early on in the week.
    <p> 
    Gather my new insights and remind myself how much I have accomplished thanks to working at Tesla.
    <p> 
    <p> --
    <p>     
    Overall, working at Tesla has been THE most challenging mountain I have attempted to climb.
    <p> 
    I felt like I made a significant impact during my tenure there with innumerable lessons and new skills I discovered within myself.
    <p> 
    I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of the mission. 
    I would do it all over again.
    <p> 
    Thank you to all the leaders who've been there for me.
    <p> 
    For now, I think I need time to continue my move to BC this year before hopping onto the next big adventure.
    <p>

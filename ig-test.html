        <h2>Are You Earning as Much as You Could Be With Instagram?</h2>

    <h3>How does your Instagram really Stack Up for your business?</h3>

        <p>By now, there are tons of ways you can use Instagram for your business / Gym / studio… but it can be overwhelming and distracting to use. </p>

        <p>I used to think I was being productive with Instagram, until I realized 60 minutes had gone by and I was liking memes and pictures of vegan food instead of building my business.</p>

        <p>Well, I tried different tricks and narrowed them down which lead my clients to making thousands of dollars from Instagram (even with accounts with less than 1,000 followers who have never sold anything from Instagram before).</p>

        <p>Justin - who recently started a local fitness bootcamp made close to £15,000 in sales directly generated from Instagram - organically - since we began working together [around 40 days ago]. And that’s starting from ZERO, no followers, no paid ads.</p>

        <p>You can do the same with your account starting TODAY. It starts with taking a good, hard look at your current account to understand what you should be doing, and where you should be spending your time for maximum profits.</p>

        <p><b>For this reason, I have put together THIS test for you. </b></p>

        <a href="https://tripleyourtribe.thrivecart.com/ig-self-assessment-test/">Download the FREE Test</a>

        <p>After doing this test, <b>you will discover at LEAST one area where you can improve </b>your Instagram to increase visibility, make more sales, connect deeper with your audience, and grow your followers ethically. </p>

        <p>One weightlifting coaching client grew her following by 257 followers in 3 days after realizing she was missing on ONE aspect.</p>

        <p>You can keep doing what you're doing, and keep getting the same results... OR you could start with diagnosing what could be optimized and grow your following, authority and your bottom line. It all starts with a few simple questions.</p>

        <p>Good luck on your test,</p>
        <p>Leon Benjamignan </p>

        <p><b>PS:</b> If you do NOT have the time to review the changes for your account yourself, then go <a href="https://leonbenj.com/ig">here</a> if you prefer that I personally review your account for you.

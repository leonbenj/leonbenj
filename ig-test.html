        <h1>Are You Earning as Much as You Could Through Instagram?</h1>

    <h3>How does your Instagram <b>really</b> stack up for your business?</h3>

        <p>By now there are tons of ways you can use Instagram for your business, gym, fitness studio… but it can be overwhelming and distracting.</p>

        <p>I used to think I was productive until I realized 60 minutes had gone by and I was sharing pictures of vegan food instead of building my business.</p>

        <p>I shook it off and tried various approaches on my intended use and I narrowed down which activities lead me and my clients 
            
        <h3 style="text-align: center;"> To make thousands of dollars from Instagram (even with accounts with less than 1,000 followers who have never sold anything from Instagram before).</h3>

        <p>Justin - who started a local fitness bootcamp made close to £15,000 in sales directly generated from Instagram - organically - since we began working together within 40 days. And that’s starting from ZERO, no followers, no paid ads.</p>
            
        <p>It starts with placing your account under my microscope to understand what's working, what's not, where you should be focusing your time for maximum output on your desired outcomes.</p>

        <p>After completing this test, you will discover at LEAST one area  you can improve your: 
            <ul>
                <li>visibility, 
                <li>sales, 
                <li>deepen your relationships, 
                <li>and grow ethically for the long-term. </p>
            </ul>

        <p>One weightlifting coach grew her following by 257 followers in 3 days after realizing she was missing out on ONE aspect from my help.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"> <b>You can do the same from your account starting TODAY.</b></p>
        
        <p>Now the choice is yours: You can keep doing what you're doing, and keep getting the same results... OR you could start with diagnosing what could be optimized and grow your following, authority and your bottom line. 
        <p>It all starts with a few simple questions. <a href="https://tripleyourtribe.thrivecart.com/ig-self-assessment-test/">Download my IG Assessment Test</a>

        <p><b>PS:</b> If you do NOT have the time to review your account yourself, then go <a href="https://leonbenj.com/ig">here</a> if you prefer that I personally go through your account (from what I can publicly gather) for you. It is not cheap, but might be worth your time.

<h2>Select Accomplishments:</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<p>
    <li><strong>Making An Impact At Tesla:</strong>
    <p>
    I was a consistent top performer in sales & delivery scoring above excellence consistently over 2.5 years, pioneered various projects in Canada: standardizing Tesla talking points for the inbound and sales teams, launched live Chat solo - increasing sales and productivity by an order of magnitude - and piloted the first location of Self-Serve Demo Drives in Canada, mentored new hires, created internal processes, promoted 3 times to quality assurance and inside sales supervisor roles.</li>
    <p>
        <li><strong>Built A Local Plant-Based Dumpling Business:</strong>
    <p> I launched a dumpling business as a ghost kitchen with my partner, inspired by flavours from all around the world. Together we rolled over 12,100 dumplings by hand, made from scatch over 8 months.  We built a loyal fan-base of 1,390 Instagram followers organically, with 289 customers and 45 repeat customers ordering up to 5 times each, partnered with 2 distributors, optimized our manufacturing speeds and kitchen space to exceed our growing demand. We pre-sold a week in advance consistently through Instagram and email.</li>
    <p>
    <li><strong>A Caring And Results-Driven Instagram Marketing Consultant:</strong>
    <p>I ran workshops on my core Instagram strategies to entrepreneurs across <a href="/speaking.html">8 live events and 8 communities as a guest expert</a> leading to increased revenue (some filling their bootcamps within days) and others making their <a href="https://leonbenj.thrivecart.com/7-day-instagram-challenge/"> first sales from Instagram within 7 days.</a> Having audited over 700 accounts, I have experience in marketing and working with entrepreneurs in various industries.</li>

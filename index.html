<h2>HOMEPAGE</h2>

<p>
<h3>Me in 30 seconds</h3>
<p>
<p>I'm a dependable person with incredibly high standards. I push myself to perform at the highest levels every day, driven to do the right things and act with integrity even when no one is looking. 
<p>
I'm a <a href="https://leonbenj.com/tesla-recap.html">recent Tesla alumni</a> as of mid-April where I was an Inside Sales Supervisor, Quality Assurance Coordinator and top performing Advisor.
<p>
Previously, I built a local plant-based dumpling business from scratch with my girlfriend, coached fitness business owners on Instagram marketing for 7 years, and also ran a beard oil business.
<p>
<h3>Currently</h3>
<p>
Practicing being a musician.  
<p>
Open to work for the next position in my professional career.
<p>
<h3>Select Accomplishments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consistent top performer at Tesla for over 2.5 years; assisted over 15,000 calls and excelled at KPIs on a weekly basis. Also, I lead a team of 9 agents and conducted weekly 1-1s which increased sales, morale, customer satisfaction and team collaboration.
<li>Exceptional written and verbal communication skills - reached chat sales conversion to 40% in a given week, demonstrated strong ability to control conversations, setting expectations, active problem-solving, handling escalations, writing in the Tesla voice for customer support and standing firm on company policy while doing the right thing.
<li>I've helped double foot traffic to brick & mortar businesses and increase online sales for fitness businesses via online marketing.
<li>Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering
<li>Purple-belt in brazilian jiu jitsu 
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Select Skills</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Analytical Problem-Solver:</b> With genuine curiosity and using first-principles thinking to understand complex problems. Agile in documenting projects in spreadsheets to make data-driven decisions. I follow a relentless yet ethical approach to sales and operations.

<li><b>Resilient and Adaptable Leader:</b> Building strong, collaborative relationships as a respected and trusted partner that others enjoy working with - including customers. I take initiative, I'm resilient, and adapt quickly to new situations, taking ownership of projects from start to finish, and determined to improve team performance by incorporating feedback fast.
 
<li><b>Empowering Team Player:</b> Supporting team success by creating an environment of collaboration and empowerment, while being resourceful and independent in finding solutions. If none exist, then I create the necessary company-wide resources for the team without being asked. 

</ul>

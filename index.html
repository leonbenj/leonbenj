<h2>Select Accomplishments I'm Proud Of:</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<p>
    <li><strong>I Was A Hands-On Instagram Marketing Expert:</strong>
    <p>I ran workshops on my core Instagram strategies to entrepreneurs across <a href="/speaking.html">8 live events and 8 communities as a guest expert</a> leading to significant revenue increases (some filling their high ticket bootcamps within days) and others making their <a href="https://leonbenj.thrivecart.com/7-day-instagram-challenge/"> first sales ever from Instagram within 7 days.</a> Having audited over 700 accounts, I have experience in marketing to various industries.</li>
<p>
    <li><strong>I Built A Plant-Based Dumpling Business:</strong>
    <p> I launched a plant-based dumpling business as a ghost kitchen with my girlfriend, inspired by flavours from all around the world. Together we rolled over 12,100 dumplings by hand, from scatch over 8 months.  We built a loyal fan-base of 1,390 Instagram followers organically, with 289 customers and 45 repeat customers ordering up to 5 times each, partnered with 2 distributors, optimized our manufacturing speeds and kitchen space to exceed our growing demand. We also pre-sold a week in advance consistently through Instagram and email by writing sales copy.</li>

<p>
    <li><strong>I Made An Impact At Tesla in Canada:</strong>
    <p>
    I was a consistent top performer in sales & delivery scoring above excellence consistently over 2.5 years in my bi-annual reviews, pioneered various projects in Canada: standardizing Tesla talking points for the inbound and sales teams, launched live Chat solo where I increased sales and productivity by an order of magnitude, and piloted the first location of Self-Serve Demo Drives in Quebec, mentored new hires, created new internal processes, promoted 3 times during my tenure to quality assurance and inside sales supervisor roles.</li>

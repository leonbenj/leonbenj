<p>
I love business. 
<p>
I love jiu jitsu. 
<p>
I speak French, Armenian, English. 
<p>
I journal a lot to understand myself and the world I'm in. 
<p>
I care about people - family, friends, clients, colleagues...
<p>
I can't just have one single mission.
<p>
I have many. 
<p>
Maybe you can relate.
<p>
Maybe you can get an idea. 
<p>
Maybe you can enjoy what I have to say. 
<p>
Maybe we'll collaborate together towards a common good. 
<p>
Let's make our day-to-day better for us and others.

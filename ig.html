        <intro>
        <p>If you need a pair of eyes to maximize your efforts on Instagram for your business, then this might be the most important page you read today.</p>
        <p>To decide if my services are right for you or not, let me ask four questions:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Do you sit in bed at the end of the day tired and frustrated that all your hard work on Instagram ends up equaling ZERO sales and minimal engagement?
        <li>Do you spend hours creating epic pictures, amazing content only to get crickets on your post?
        <li>HATE "spam bots" and would LOVE to have actual REAL people (with money ready to invest in YOUR services) actively commenting and interacting on your posts?
        <li>Continually crushed and confused on how to turn followers into fans into raving customers?!
        </ul>


        <p>Hi, I'm Leon Benjamignan and I've worked with hundreds of business owners since 2016 in the fitness space and other markets. 
            
        <p>I've developed my methods to grow my own beard oil business and my local plant-based <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dumplingnationmtl/">dumpling business</a> (we grew so much that we couldn't keep up with orders!). I've also helped fitness business owners start from scratch and get to 15,000 british pounds in sales in less than a month.</li>.
            
        <p>In essence, I've coached clients to communicate clearer and improve the quality of their local and online traffic through Instagram.
            
        <p>This resulted in:
        <li>Exposure to people who actually want to hear what my clients had to say,
        <li>More leads & clients,
        <li>Signing sponsorship deals with brands.
        </p>

    <p>See you on the other side,</p>

    <p>PS: Where will you be 28 days from now if you choose not to invest in one of my offers? No doubt you're still a bit unclear on how to get significant leads from Instagram or will be wasting time on the app as it's designed to suck up your time by scrolling. Allow me to help me get you in, and get you out of Instagram while focusing on just the stuff that works. </p>

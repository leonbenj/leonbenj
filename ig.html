        <h2>Leon's Instagram Services & Resources</h2>

        <intro>
        <p>If you need a pair of eyes to maximize your efforts on Instagram for your business, then this might be the most important page you read today.</p>
        <p>To decide if my services are right for you or not, let me ask four questions:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Do you sit in bed at the end of the day tired and frustrated that all your hard work on Instagram ends up equaling ZERO sales and minimal engagement?
        <li>Do you spend hours creating epic pictures, amazing content only to get crickets on your post?
        <li>HATE "spam bots" and would LOVE to have actual REAL people (with money ready to invest in YOUR services) actively commenting and interacting on your posts?
        <li>Continually crushed and confused on how to turn followers into fans into raving customers?!
        </ul>


        <p>Hi, I'm Leon Benjamignan and I've worked with hundreds of business owners since 2016 with their Instagram positioning and marketing to attract real clients. 
            
        <p>I've developed my methods to grow my own beard oil business, and then my local plant-based <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dumplingnationmtl/">dumpling business</a> (we had to pre-sell for the week ahead to ensure production met demand and we quickly outgrew in orders to keep up). 

        <p>Having documented my journey on my progress, people reached out to me to coach them on how to apply it to their business. 
            
        <p>In short, I've coached clients on how to position themselves, communicate clearer and improve the quality of their presence on Instagram - be it as a local or online business. I've helped both achieve their goals. This resulted in:
        
        <ul>
        <li>Exposure to the audience they wanted
        <li>Real interactions with people,
        <li>Actual paying clients clients,
        <li>And even signing sponsorship deals with brands.
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>To dig in further, here are some of my services and resources:</p>

    <p>PS: Where will you be 28 days from now if you choose not to invest in one of my offers? No doubt you're still a bit unclear on how to get significant leads from Instagram or will be wasting time on the app as it's designed to suck up your time by scrolling. Allow me to help me get you in, and get you out of Instagram while focusing on just the stuff that works. </p>

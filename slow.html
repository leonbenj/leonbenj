My favorite book on mindset: <a href="https://a.co/d/2j5KiE5">Mindset Matters Most</a> by Brian Grasso.
<p>
What I always remember from that book is Sawubona. 
I think about it all the time after realizing this existed. 
<p>
A lot more people using Sawubona, I think would be a good thing. 
<p>
It translates from Zulu to English as "I see you" - the entire "you". 
Genuinely caring for another person when you cross them on the street. 
Not centered around my concerns when they bring things up. 
Used as a formal greeting.
<p>
I feel like I do this a lot with my closest friends. 
<p>
Giving my full attention.
<p>
Some lighter relationships feel like I don't go as deep. Or when I'm more stressed out and short on a deadline. 
<p>
But I think having someone hear YOU out brings the attention to the right place and slows things down.
<p>
This helps you SEE others. 
<p>
You can start that cycle today. 
<p>
Slow down and try Sawubona.

            <h1>Here's How A Simple Spreadsheet Can Grow Your Confidence Around Money</h1>

            <!-- Introduction -->
            <p>My name is Leon Benjamignan and, the first thing you should know about me is... I am not a financial advisor.  I'm not an expert on money either.  I never went to business school and I don't have a degree in anything related remotely to finances.  In fact, the only thing I consider myself an 'expert' about is in <span class="highlight">spreadsheets</span>.</p>
            <p>I used to think, "if I'm making money weekly, I should be okay," but as things grew complicated with moving across the country, increased housing costs and emergency vet visits, <b>keeping up with my finances wasn't as straight-forward anymore. </b>
            <p>I was fed up with guessing my finances so I designed a spreadsheet around my simple philosphy and it's worked for me since - and it possibly could for you too.</p>
            <h2>Here's the quick story:</h2>

            <!-- Story -->
            <p>Over a year ago, I planned to move from Quebec to British Colombia - away from all my family and friends.  To my shock, I got laid off 3 months before my moving date.  Strike 1.  
            <p>My plans were shaken but I was dedicated to move anyway.  As I arrived, my car insurance nearly tripled.  Strike 2.  
            <p>My rent? Practically doubled.  Strike 3!</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">I felt the pressure of totally being on my own.</h2>
            <p>Later, I secured a contract job (a breath of fresh air!).  But then, my cat got very sick which lead to the most expensive way a doctor could tell me it was stress (even after getting a second and third opinion to rule anything out)... 
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">So I sucked it up and put matters into my own hands.</h2> 
            <p>I had to take care of my family after all.  I needed to ground myself in <span class="highlight">reality</span>: 
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">How long could I support my family financially?</h2>
            <p>This is when I leaned on my strengths.  As rough as it was to structure the first time, I organized a way to calculate all my money in a new spreadsheet <b>to know exactly how long I could survive</b>.</p>
            <p>As soon as my first full entry was in, I sighed in relief.  
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">A deep sense of <span class="highlight">confidence</span> sparked within me.</h2>
            <p>I knew exactly where I stood.  All these months of stress from the tension of "flying blind" instantly disappeared.  I also designed my spreadsheet so I could update it anytime and see my progress.  
            <p>Did it work?  
            <p>It sure did.</p>
            <p>After few weeks of this new habit, I spotted how I could improve my situation.  I took action:  
                
            <ul class="checkmark-list">
                <li>I secured a job. </li> 
                <li>I eliminated <span class="highlight">$53,000</span> of debt by selling my car.</li>
                <li>My savings rate increased.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>I didn't even want to spend more to screw up my upward trends... my money kept going where I wanted it to. I understood how <span class="highlight">I controlled </span>my flow of money.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">That's when I realized my tracker wasn't just tracking my numbers... it helped me build a life of freedom and control.</h2>
            <p>And now, I've made a version so that you can do the same.</p>
            <p> 

            <!-- Features -->
            <h2>Here's what it's all about:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You'll know how many months you can survive without any income (crucial to know when youâ€™re in a crisis situation.)

<li class="bold-bullet">You'll know approximately when you'll have 12 months of living expenses saved up. (Or any number of months you want)
                <li>How much is your lifestyle costing you? You'll be able to know if you're on track towards your goal - or just to become aware of your burn rate. Are you in the negative, or stagnating and you don't even know it? Here's your chance to find out.</li>
                <li class="bold-bullet">You'll know your <span class="highlight">actual</span> monthly: expenses, income, savings potential, your monthly history and more - it's all personalized based on your real numbers and lifestyle throughout the year.</li>
                <li>Know all your key finance numbers by entering a few cells in a spreadsheet. Plug-and-play and it will calculate the rest for you. No math required on your part.</li>      
                <li>You can implement common financial strategies such as the <span class="highlight">70/20/10 rule</span>- where 70% of your income goes towards living expenses, 20% to savings, 10% to debt repayment. You can finally visualize those percentages with your actual numbers - even if you're just curious.</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- Placeholder for headline after 5th bullet -->
            <h2>Become aware of your money rhythms to make better decisions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="bold-bullet">Spot your trends early so you can adjust your money habits (I saved <span class="highlight">thousands of dollars</span> already this way)</li>
                <li>The more you track, the clearer picture it will paint. You'll see common fluctuations based on when you get paid vs doing groceries or any big expenses, etc. (the <span class="highlight">summary page</span> shows you this).</li>
                <li class="bold-bullet">Track your net worth (from <span class="highlight">day one</span>).</li>
                <li>Know your actual savings rate based on your current lifestyle... and every month moving forward. (The earlier you start, the better. And you'll be able to compare your history as well.)</li>
                <li class="bold-bullet">Track your debt over time - so you can laser in on your progress towards eliminating it. (useful in the future or if you have any debt right now)</li>
                <li>Should you hold off on buying a big ticket item? You can make an educated decision on the timing of it since you'll see your cash flow with this.</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- Placeholder for headline after 10th bullet -->
            <h2>Future-proof your money-tracking</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="bold-bullet">Your chance to develop a simple habit of managing money so that you'll be prepared when you'll have more. (Note: this is NOT a money management course, but rather a tool to track your money to develop your own strategies.)</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Pay once, track forever.</span> No recurring payments or subscriptions.</li>
                <li class="bold-bullet">Ability to export your data easily for external analysis: so you can show it to your accountant, financial advisor, or to any Artificial Intelligence (if you swing that way).</li>
                <li>How to view the history of your bank account statistics without connecting them to this tracker. No bank login connections needed - so your money stays <span class="highlight">untouchable</span>.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>NOTE: This tracker is NOT for everyone</h2>
<ul>
    <li>This is NOT for those who don't like Google as the current version relies on Google Sheets. I will ensure additional spreadsheet compatibility in the future - you'll get all future updates for free.</li>
    <li>This is NOT for those who want automatic imports. Manual entries are intentional for a few reasons: 1) forces you to audit your accounts, 2) avoids sync issues, 3) ensures longevity with your important numbers as software and services can change, break or shut down. This way you are in control of this file. </li>
     <li class="bold-bullet">Once you know where to check for your numbers in your accounts, it takes between <span class="highlight">5 to 15 minutes</span> per week to fill out. You'll even know when its recommended to do a check-in. Youâ€™ll see a message at the top of the summary page.</li>
</ul>
            <!-- Placeholder for headline after 15th bullet -->
            <h2>Just a few more benefits for you... </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Rewire your mind around money. You might think this process seems boring. Most long-term advice is boring. Because boring works. Money is boring. Once you grasp the power of of what you are building, I think you will realize how exciting long-term money can become.</li>
                <li>You are buying directly from the creator (me) who cares and wants this to be as useful for you as it was for me. I personally use this version weekly and guide you if you have any questions so that you use it to the fullest.</li>
                
            </ul>
            <!-- Offer Section -->
<h2>Okay, so how much for my special spreadsheet?</h2>
<p>Just $30. 
<p>That's right, for only $30 you can receive instant access to my Finance Tracker to help you build your money habits over the long-term.
<p>Why only $30? 
<p>Because I wanted to put this in the hands of as many people as possible in its early phases.
<p>If you need to justify spending $30 on your money management habit for decades to come, then just skip having fast food for a day. 
<p>This is a drop in the bucket compared to what others pay for finance trackers - and with this, you only pay once. Plus, if you use it and you hate it, show me what needs improvement and I'll work on a fix for you.

            <h1>Here's How A Simple Spreadsheet Can Grow Your Confidence Around Money</h1>

            <!-- Introduction -->
            <p>My name is Leon Benjamignan and, the first thing you should know about me is... I am not a financial advisor.  I'm not an expert on money either.  I never went to business school and I don't have a degree in anything related remotely to finances.  In fact, the only thing I consider myself an 'expert' about is in <span class="highlight">spreadsheets</span>.</p>
            <p>I used to think, "if I'm making money every other week, I should be okay," but as things got complicated with moving across the country, increased housing costs and emergency vet visits, <b>keeping up with my finances wasn't as straight-forward anymore. </b>
            <p>I got fed up with guessing my finances so I designed a spreadsheet around my simple philosphy and it's worked for me since - and it possibly could for you too.</p>
            <h2>Here's the quick story:</h2>

            <!-- Story -->
            <p>Over a year ago, I planned to move from Quebec to British Colombia - away from all my family and friends.  To my shock, I got laid off 3 months before my moving date.  Strike 1.  
            <p>My plans were shaken but I was dedicated to move anyway.  As I arrived, my car insurance nearly tripled.  Strike 2.  
            <p>My rent? Practically doubled.  Strike 3!</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">I felt the pressure of totally being on my own.</h2>
            <p>Later, I secured a contract job (a breath of fresh air!).  But then, my cat got very sick which lead to the most expensive way a doctor could tell me it was stress (even after getting a second and third opinion to rule anything out)... 
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">So I sucked it up and put matters into my own hands.</h2> 
            <p>I had to take care of my family after all.  I needed to ground myself in <span class="highlight">reality</span>: 
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">How long could I support my family financially?</h2>
            <p>This is when I leaned on my strengths.  As rough as it was to structure the first time, I organized a way to calculate all my money in a new spreadsheet <b>to know exactly how long I could survive</b>.</p>
            <p>As soon as my first full entry was in, I sighed in relief.  
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">A deep sense of <span class="highlight">confidence</span> grew within me.</h2>
            <p>I knew exactly where I stood.  All these months of stress and tension of "flying blind" instantly disappeared.  I designed my spreadsheet so I could update it anytime and see my progress.  
            <p>Did it work?  
            <p>It sure did.</p>
            <p>After few weeks of this new habit, I spotted how I could improve my situation.  I took action:  
                
            <ul class="checkmark-list">
                <li>I secured a job. </li> 
                <li>I eliminated <span class="highlight">$53,000</span> of debt by selling my car.</li>
                <li>My savings rate increased.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>I didn't even want to spend more and screw up my upward trends... my money kept going where I wanted it to. I understood <span class="highlight">I controlled </span>my flow of money.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">That's when I realized my tracker wasn't just tracking my numbers... it helped me build a life of freedom and control.</h2>
            <p>And now, I've made a shareable version so that you can do the same.</p>
            <p> 

            <!-- Features -->
            <h2>Here's what it's all about:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Know all your key finance numbers by entering a few cells in a spreadsheet. Plug-and-play and it will calculate the rest for you. No math required on your part.</li>
                <li class="bold-bullet">Once you know where to check for your numbers in your accounts, it takes between <span class="highlight">5 to 15 minutes</span> per week to fill out.</li>
                <li>You'll know your actual: monthly expenses, monthly income, monthly potential savings, months of living expenses saved, when you'll hit your savings target, updating averages of each, and more - it's all personalized based on your real numbers and lifestyle throughout the year.</li>
                <li>Track your debt over time too - so you can laser in on your progress towards eliminating it. (useful in the future or if you have any debt right now)</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Pay once, track forever.</span> No recurring payments or subscriptions or pressure to have you use it.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Placeholder for headline after 5th bullet -->
            <h2>Become aware of your money rhythms to make better decisions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Spot your trends early so you can adjust your money habits (I saved <span class="highlight">thousands of dollars</span> already this way)</li>
                <li class="bold-bullet">The more you track, the clearer picture it will paint. You'll see common fluctuations based on when you get paid vs doing groceries or any big expenses, etc. (the <span class="highlight">summary page</span> shows you this).</li>
                <li>Track your net worth (from <span class="highlight">day one</span>).</li>
                <li class="bold-bullet">Discover your savings rate based on your current lifestyle... and every month moving forward. (The earlier you start, the better. And you'll be able to compare your history as well.)</li>
                <li>Know your burn rate: how much is your lifestyle costing you? You'll be able to know if you're on track towards your goal - or just to become aware of it. Are you in the negative or stagnating and you don't even know it? Here's your chance to find out.</li>
                <li>Should you hold off on buying a big ticket item? You can make an educated decision on the timing of it since you'll see your cash flow with this.</li>
            
            <li>You can implement common financial strategies such as the <span class="highlight">70/20/10 rule</span>- where 70% of your income goes towards living expenses, 20% to savings, 10% to debt repayment. You can finally visualize those percentages with your actual numbers - even if you're just curious.</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- Placeholder for headline after 10th bullet -->
            <h2>Future-proof your money-tracking</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="bold-bullet">Your chance to develop a simple habit of managing money so that you'll be prepared when you'll have more. (Note: this is NOT a money management course, but rather a tool to track your money to develop your own strategies.)</li>
                <li>You'll even know when its time to do a check-in. You’ll see a warning at the top of the summary page if it’s recommended to do a check in or not.</li>
                <li class="bold-bullet">How to view the history of your bank account statistics without connecting them to this tracker. No bank login connections needed - so your money stays <span class="highlight">untouchable</span>.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Placeholder for headline after 15th bullet -->
            <h2>Just a few more benefits for you... </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Rewire your mind around money. You might think this process seems boring. Most long-term advice is boring. Because boring works. Money is boring. Once you grasp the power of of what you are building, I think you will realize how exciting long-term money can become.</li>
                <li>You are buying directly from the creator (Leon) who cares and wants this to be as useful for you as it was for them. I personally use this version weekly and will guide you if you have any questions about it or using it. (happy to create custom trainings around it for easier use)</li>
                <li class="bold-bullet">Ability to export your data easily for external analysis: so you can show it to your accountant, financial advisor, or to any Artificial Intelligence (if you swing that way).</li>
                
            </ul>
            <p>Note there are no automatic data imports from your bank - which means no more erroneous duplicate entries to mess up your stats or worries about broken connections. You will need to manually check your bank accounts. It does NOT take as long as you might think. (I even did it when I had 6% battery left and it took less than 5 mins). Once you know where to look, it is a simple in-and-out and you'll know all your key numbers.</p>

            <!-- Not for Everyone Section -->
            <h2>As you can see, this tracker is NOT for everyone.</h2>
            <p>This is NOT for those who don't like Google - as this version relies on Google Sheets. Not all the formulas are directly compatible with other spreadsheet software yet - but I plan on adding this functionality in the coming months. If you prefer NOT to buy this now for this feature, that's fine - let me know which you might spreadsheet software you prefer.</p>
            <p>This is NOT for those who want an automatic import of your numbers. Manual entries is intentional for a few reasons:</p>
            <ul class="checkmark-list">
                <li>For one, you'll have <span class="highlight">full control</span> of your data. Software and service providers change, break or shut down all the time.  If you want longevity with your important numbers, using a format that stands the test of time for numbers, makes the most sense (in my opinion anyway). You can export your data to other apps later on if you want. This can be the home-base and manipulate your data elsewhere.</li>
                <li class="bold-bullet">Reason #2, you'll avoid sync issues from auto-imports which can mess things up if there are duplicate data. Especially when transferring money from one account to the other. When I was with Tangerine bank, I had auto-transfers on and it would mess all my income numbers in Mint at the time. No more of that.</li>
                <li>And finally, I think it's a mistake to use those auto-import apps since it adds a <span class="highlight">disconnect</span> between you and your numbers. Forcing you to check your accounts, review your spending and your income is a good thing. This is by design. It's a way of auditing yourself now instead of waiting for a big surprise down the line when shit hits the fan. 
                    <p>The more you do these check-ins, the faster it becomes, and soon, it will only take you like 5-15 minutes per week, tops. If you can't manage that, then you should not bother getting this. I'm sure there is another app or tool out there for you. Will you use it regularly? Or will you input your data once and forget about it? If you can bring that effort, you will be set to track your numbers forever in a simple way I've arranged for you no matter what changes happen at other companies.</li>
            </ul>

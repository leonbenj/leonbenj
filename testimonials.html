"It is not difficult to see that Leon truly embodies Tesla's mission of accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy. Leon's willingness to help, passion for excellence, and unwavering attention to customer experience have all contributed to the brand's success in Canada. It was an honour to work with Leon and I can not think of anyone that is more dependable. Any company will be lucky to have Leon in their roster.

    <h3>Leon took his listening strategies, sales acumen, and genuine concern for client satisfaction to new heights</h3>
    <p>
In 2021 I had the pleasure of working close with Leon, as I trained the newly developed Virtual Advisor team. Leon along with a few others that were part of this NEW department had prospective potentials.
<p>
I have witnessed his growth within the team, to expand (and deservingly so) to other facets of Tesla. Leon took his listening strategies, sales acumen, and genuine concern for client satisfaction to new heights as a coordinator then supervisor. I am confident in his future successes as he is always eager to learn to better himself for the company. Factor in that he is so focused in ensuring our clients are satisfied with the company, product and his expertiese... he will be a fantastic asset to any organization.

      "I came to Leon for some very high level pointers and advice surrounding Instagram and how to gain some traction and reach with my posts and page, after a few back and forths I put into action gus advice and from January to now I've gained 4 thousand followers, gained huge amounts of engagement compared to before and going from strength to strength and this was just from basic steps. 
    <p> 
    The advice Leon gave was great, easy to follow and implement and has materialised exactly how he said it would. If you're struggling to kick start you Instagram I really recommend using his knowledge, the guys a master of the app!!"

    <h3>More people are engaging with the content and followers are staying. Defo has been worth the investment.</h3>
    <p>
        "Been using the hashtag service Leon offered for maybe 2/3 weeks now. My posts generally got about 20 likes a photo it's now constantly in the 50s. 
        <p>More people are engaging with the content and followers are staying instead of the usual followers who follow and unfollow. 
        <p>I'm unsure on the exact numbers but Leon's been tracking them for me since it's started and it's growing. I'd come to a standstill with my growth not sure if it was the algorithms that had changed but have been struggling for last 6 months. Defo has been worth the investment, plus all the bonuses shit load of content not made my way through half of it yet but just gotta implement it now." <br>

    <h3>I got 4 clients off of Instagram in the first 2 weeks. I have never signed up clients off of IG before.</h3>
    <p>
        "Many have reached out asking what Leon is doing with my IG. I'd like to answer "Ninja Unicorn Wizard Magic" ... but that probably isn't a satisfactory answer.
        <p>
        I got 4 clients off of Instagram in the first 2 weeks of January (3 in my group challenge and 1 VIP 1-21). <strong>I have never signed up clients off of IG before.</strong>
        <p>
        He is growing my audience in a targeted fashion, while running analytics to eliminate followers who are not engaging or bot accounts. Our primary goal is turning my audience into a much more engaged one.
        <p>
        <strong>So not just vanity metrics (followers) but followers that engage.</strong>
        <p>He also keeps an eye on my profile, keeps me up to date on latest IG happenings and I also use his Hashtag Domination tool.
        <p>So, it's my responsibility to create content, and to reply to comments and DMs on my profile, but he handles the outreach, and so my profile grows and grows more engaged while I sleep ...
        Basically he gets my content in front of the most meaningful eyeballs.
        <p>The verdict? Engagement keeps climbing. I have a long way to go, but damn, that path got shorter, thanks to Leon.
        <p>Best option. Have a chat with him. If he can't help you, he'll straight up tell you. Not only that, he'll set you straight so that you do the things you need to do, to maximise the help you get from him.
        <p>But just like you don't lift weights for your clients ... he doesn't create the content for you. That needs to come from you, if you want to form meaningful connections with your audience.”<br>

<h3>His passion for design and his commitment for excellence brings a joy to all those working around him.</h3>
<p>
"Leon did an audit of my IG account. 
<p>
His recommendations were SO helpful and to the point. It was some common practices that are a must do for anyone on IG and also a series of personalized recommendations for my brand and business.
<p>
He is thorough and obviously cares about getting his clients results. 
<p>
In the online marketing space it is not always easy to find people with integrity and who care about the results their clients get...
<p>
Leon is an exceptional person! I highly recommend him for anything he is offering."

        "Shout out to Leon Benjamin for the great tips he just gave me on my IG  account! I always forget that IG is basically a 40 hour/week job in and of itself and I kind of get 'bored' because I lack direction or know how on really what to do! 
        <p>
        This quick chat gave me so much direction! Thank you to all of the teachers in here teaching me how to start, where to start, and the correct rate of growth to success, it's all about the journey and I am so happy that I get to learn from REAL GENUINE fucking BADASSES!" <br>

    <p>
        "Hey Leon, Numbers on posts and engagement consistently going up, seem to be in over 50s on most posts in likes now and more people engaging. Not sure if it's because of your magical work or because my contents getting better 🤔 😂 No I think it's a good mix of both, I'm making a lot more effort to not post shit and have more purposeful, meaningful content towards the clients I'm aiming at. 
        <p>But the hashtags are getting a lot more engagement from others who wouldn't of seen my page. Following is creeping up as well. Changed the thumbnail around like you said and that's getting more views on those videos."<br>

        <h3>A fantastic mentor to me. I finally reached over 10,000 followers</h3>
        <p>
        "I am here to tell you about how great and how greatly improved my Instagram is using Leon Benjamin's hashtag domination service.
        <p>
        I've known Leon now I think for a little bit over a year and not only has he been a fantastic mentor to me through Instagram (period) and in terms of how to work my feed, how to work my stories, how to work my messages and everything. I could go on droning on about that. That's a whole other video for this but specifically the Hashtag Domination service.
        <p>
        I struggled a lot with hashtags in terms of what to use for my niche, what to use for my market, which pictures to use which hashtags on, and Leon's Hashtag Domination Service, I actually ended up using twice because not only did I need it but it was so effective for me because I was putting on hashtags that I was kind of coming up with myself.
        <p>
        I was doing a little bit of research, you know what, I'll change that. I was doing way too much research and getting zero return. When I was taking a look at my insights, no one was finding my posts from hashtags, not a single person.
        <p>
        So not only did I hire Leon for this specific service, but when people were finding my posts that had never found them before I finally reached over 10,000 followers so I can finally use a swipe up in my stories, which I am absolutely, absolutely certain that I would never have gotten there without the usage of Leon's Hashtag Domination Service.
        <p>
        So boys and girls, I can't recommend it enough. The price on it is so ridiculously cheap I would have probably paid $500 plus for it. So if he still has this service available jump on it. You won't regret it and if you're like me you'll use it twice and you'll be able to grow your Instagram like never before.
        <p>So thanks a bunch Leon and I can't wait to keep growing with you over the years."<br>

        "Nouvellement en affaire, mon studio de d'entraînement de boxe ouvrira ses portes le mois prochain. J'avais besoin d'une expertise externe sur les stratégies marketing et de vente de mes services. Lors d'une rencontre d'environ 45 mins avec Leon, nous avons échangé sur les valeurs, la définition de mon service et mes objectifs. Il m'a donné des avenues de réflexion afin de répondre de façon optimale aux besoins des futurs clients et, simultanément, ceux de mon entreprise.
